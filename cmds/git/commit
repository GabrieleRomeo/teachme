echo -e "\t-a"

echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t-C <commit>"

echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t-c <commit>"
echo -e "\t--reedit-message=<commit>"
echo -e "\tLike -C, but with -c the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the commit message."
echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--fixup=<commit>"
echo -e "\tConstruct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash. The commit message will be the subject line from the specified commit with a prefix of "fixup! ". See git-rebase[1] for details."
echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--squash=<commit>"
echo -e "\tConstruct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash. The commit message subject line is taken from the specified commit with a prefix of "squash! ". Can be used with additional commit message options (-m/-c/-C/-F). See git-rebase[1] for details."
echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--reset-author"
echo -e "\tWhen used with -C/-c/--amend options, or when committing after a a conflicting cherry-pick, declare that the authorship of the resulting commit now belongs to the committer. This also renews the author timestamp."
echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--short"

echo -e "\t--author=<author>"
echo -e "\tOverride the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard A U Thor <author@example.com> format. Otherwise <author> is assumed to be a pattern and is used to search for an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=<author>); the commit author is then copied from the first such commit found."

echo -e "\t-t <file>"
echo -e "\t--template=<file>"
echo -e "\tWhen editing the commit message, start the editor with the contents in the given file. The commit.template configuration variable is often used to give this option implicitly to the command. This mechanism can be used by projects that want to guide participants with some hints on what to write in the message in what order. If the user exits the editor without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect when a message is given by other means, e.g. with the -m or -F options."

echo -e "\t-s"
echo -e "\t--signoff"
echo -e "\tAdd Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log message.

echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--allow-empty-message"
echo -e "\tLike --allow-empty this command is primarily for use by foreign SCM interface scripts. It allows you to create a commit with an empty commit message without using plumbing commands like git-commit-tree[1]."

echo -e "\t"
echo -e "\t--amend"
echo -e "\tReplace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The recorded tree is prepared as usual (including the effect of the -i and -o options and explicit pathspec), and the message from the original commit is used as the starting point, instead of an empty message, when no other message is specified from the command line via options such as -m, -F, -c, etc. The new commit has the same parents and author as the current one (the --reset-author option can countermand this)."
